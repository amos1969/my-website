Welcome to my New Website

The plan is that I'm going to talk about my experiences teaching Computing to 11-18 year olds, and my experiences
helping retrain and focus existing teachers in the teaching of Computing.

I am a CAS Master Teacher and as such I'm expected to set up courses and get other teachers to come and take part in
them. Hopefully along the way the attendees to these course will gain in experience and confidence enough that they'll
be able to go back to their classrooms and inspire a new generation of students who will not only be digitally-literate
but also coding-literate.
