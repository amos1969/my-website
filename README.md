# Dave Ames Website

This repository will contain the files which make up the main part of dave-ames.net (my website).

Initially trying out Hugo to generate a static site, but may  just default back to Joomla if it proves too tricky to
configure. 

Suggestions for improvements, correction of spelling mistakes and anything else sensible welcome.

Cheers

Dave
